### ðŸ§± First Terraform Module: `modules/landing-zone`

I will include:
- VNET
- Subnets
- Network Security Groups
- Resource Group
- Diagnostics
- Key Vault

Would you like me to:
- Add default values for quick demos?
- Include support for **dev/test/prod environments**?
- Keep it as **one consolidated module**, or split into submodules (networking, identity, etc.)?

---

Shall I now:
1. Create the `README.md` and upload the first version?
2. Generate the `landing-zone` module folder with sample Terraform code?

Let me know if you want both or just start with one.
